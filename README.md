# Model
### Tools and Library
We get the dataset of face shape from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niten19/face-shape-dataset) <br>
We are using some library and tools like : 
- Google Colaboratory for running and testing the program
- TensorFlow for building image
- Keras for building models

### Simple Step To Replicate
- Run the program using google collab or other platform
- Prepare API from kaggle dataset
- Run all cell
